                    Click2Promote.Me is an SEO tool, that will help you to keep track of your online campaigns for your web site.<br/><br/><br/></p></li> 
                    <li><p>How does it work?<br/><br/> 
                    Click2Promote.Me searches online sources, the two most popular search engines and social networks<br/>
                    and stores the results, for later usage.<br/><br/><br/></p></li> 
                    <li><p>What should I do to keep track of my campaigns?<br/><br/>
                    Well, it's simple, just create an account.<br/><br/><br/></p></li> 
                    <li><p>Will having an account here improve my page rank?<br/><br/> 
                    Click2Promote.me is just a monitoring/tracking tool, so, no.<br/><br/><br/></p></li>

                    It takes time to get some results.<br/>
                    If you are a new user, the first time you log in, you won't see anything.<br/><br/><br/></p></li>
